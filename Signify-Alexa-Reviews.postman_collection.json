Nope. Anything remotely technical requires you to use this app. And this app is painful to use. It starts off tyrying to push echo dot conversations on me. It's got 3 buttons that all seem to do the same thing (start conversations with people over echos). If you tell alexa to conncet to bluetooth she tells you to use this app (why? Its the 21st century! Why cant you just find and pair without me having to manually do it in an app), but she then says to install the skill in smart home. Smart home, list devices.. Cant find bluetooth speakers. Ok, skills, i guess i have to install a stupid skill for bluetooth. The skills section of the app is a hot mess. The search funtion flatout DOES NOT WORK. On top of that, apparently we're still in the dark ages of smart devices because every vendor under the sun has their own stupid skills app they want you to install on alexa. This s reams of no standadizations yet. Alexa shouldnt need to learn \\\"skills\\\" to connect to smart devices. She has to simply because smart device manufacturers havent standardized things yet. Everyone of them wants to be primma donna with their own skill app, so in addition to painfully digging for it, you have to pray the vendor actually put time into making it work (theres a reason they have star ratings on the skills...ugh). Anyways, i have to google up how to pair alexa to bluetooth speakers (that very necessity means alexa is failing at her GD job, bc she tells me to go to this stupid app instead of doing it directly, and this app is a hot mess to use). There is a bluetooth section. But the app can only seem to find ONE device at a time. Your device didnt show up? Hit back and try again, like you're at a roullette table hoping your number comes up. Ugh! Finally my speakers show up, and the app sits there trying to connect. My phone takes like 2 seconds to connect to them when I do it through settings. But alexa (echo dot) takes forever. Why?! Then you exit, try again, but she lists them as a decice she knows BUT IS NOT PAIRED TO. PAIR TO THE GD SPEAKERS FFS! You click on them in the list, app cooks then finally pairs. Does alexa say anything to automatcally confirm she's using the speakers? No. So you have to ask her something stupid to get her to speak and see if shes using the speakers. This way more painful then it should be. You can make a list using her, but to delete it \\\"use the app\\\". Why? DELETE THE GD LIST WHEN I TELL YOU! And lists are useless. I make a list of songs. Tell alexa to play the songs in the list. Nope. She can't do that. I make a list of numbers. Give me the sum total of those numbers. Nope. They need to add WAY more functionality to lists if they're going to be of any use. They're basically one dimensional string arrays you cant do anything with. So close yet so far. Next we have the tplink smart plug amazon suggested we buy when we got the echo dot. Well we have a living room lamp thats a pita to turn on and off so it'd be great to just tell alexa to do that. Try to get that thing going is a pita in and of itself (plug in, install ANOTHER app, hook to it, hook to network, create yet another login, etc). Finally get it going as a smart plug. Now we have to pair it with alexa. Open skills, install more crap, look for device IN THE APP bc alexa is too stupid to pair using just voice, finally get them paired. \\\"Alexa turn on the (light name)\\\". \\\"I'm sorry I can't find that device.\\\" YES YOU CAN! I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT IN YOUR APP! I CAN EVEN USE YOUR APP TO MANUALLY TURN IT ON AND OFF! WHY CAN'T YOU VOICE COMMAND IT?! This was one of the reasons we got the echo dor and it CAN'T DO IT'S GD JOB! They need to make alexa be able to do more of this maintenance crap through her instead of this stupid app. They need to standardize smart devices and get rid of skills. But if they force you to install skills, FIX THE GD SEARCH. This app is painful and makes me want to get rid of alexa.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"PreliminaryHerring\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"iTunes\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 2,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"Painful\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-12-10T18:41:21.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"Not possible to get past the page where it asks for permissions (none of the buttons except “Learn more” work).\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"jgirard\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"iTunes\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"Broken on iPhone X\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-12-10T19:43:10.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"This app is unusable, it launches and then doesn’t finish loading...hangs.

Now I think it's suffering from it's popularity and Amazon can't handle the increased use of its service and is trying to reduce the load on its service reducing the functionality of the app and slowing the  responses from the devices. Now finding devices responding to random noise as wake word and sometimes not responding to wake word unless your a foot away and yelling, might as well use physical controls. Response to commands is deteriorating, Will give Alexa command to play song, Alexa responds with the correct title to the song but says it's not in the library even though I'm looking at the song with the exact title in my library. If I keep repeating the command with Alexa giving the EXACT SAME CORRECT SONG TITLE back every time eventually instead of saying she can't find the song it will start playing.  This may not sound like a review of the app but the app only has a use if the Alexa AI functions usefully.

I just looked online what this \\\"app\\\" is supposed to look like, according to this website on Amazon Alexa; according to what is showing in the graphic pictures, I don't have any of that on my Samsung Galaxy phone.  All I can find on this app on my phone is the same selections as it was when I first downloaded it to my phone, nothing changed.  The App logo picture changed; that is all that has changed on my phone!  So, I CANNOT access that calling/messaging feature to connect my friends/family on Alexa to have Alexa call them!  Therefore I changed my rating of 4 star to a 3 star....I might even go to a 2 star if I can't do any of the updated features on my Samsung Galaxy phone!  Thanks alot!!!

Learning is important and doing this basic troubleshootings can save time. Trust me this is based in experience and I know that this is frustrating and disappointing but still technology is not dormant so we should never stop learning as well.

We can't the app open to cached data and refresh in the background?  Worse, if it suddenly finds a connection it will go back to the home page.   The rest of the features are similarly half-baked and poorly tested. The app is ok for checking up on your Echo but not much else.  Finally, on the latest update Amazon suddenly needs access to every permission on the phone.  Contact list, running apps, phone calls, everything.

Both Echo and the Alexa app. The weather skill can't even tell you humidity. Now, as of July 28, control of Wemo devices has become erratic and semi-functional. I have updated Wemo device firmware, re-enabled the Wemo account connection, re-dscovered devices within the Alexa app, but it's still extremely retarded, with very long delays between the command and whatever execution it decides to implement (which varies from attempt to attempt.) I might blame Wemo, since it's a terrible app as well, but all devices are currently working fine from the Wemo app. My main motivation with Alexa/Echo was home automation control, but it's not reliable. Waking up to a noise, and saying \\\"Alexa; lights on\\\" should, you know, turn on the lights. But Alexa hesitates for a substantial period of time, then might (or might not) turn on a totally random selection of Wemo devices. Not ready for Prime time, pun intended. Alexa and my Echo devices are mostly just music streaming speakers now, and the only devices with a decent speaker for that purpose are the tall original Echos. Besides, with Amazon devices, unlike Google Home, you can't get the same stream coordinated on multiple devices concurrently. The Echo Show speakers are very directional (and the device is also hard of hearing.)

Just say a name of a song or artist and it will be played. I think most reviews are due to user error and not the device. Sure the app could use a little work but for the most part it works flawlessly. Easy to find skills and set alarms, add more devices and link my smart home devices. I don't know why people say it's hard to connect to WiFi because it is the easiest device I've ever hooked up to my wifi. Its never lost connection either. Only when the power has gone out but as soon as it's back on so is alexa. I have over 70 devices paired with the app and alexa has not once messed up when giving a command to lock a door or turn on a light.

This app has never been great but we use to be able to get the shopping list to open after a couple mins of trying.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"Aaron Rideout\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"App doesn't load properly it is a white screen with two nonworking buttons\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"Jonathan Mcgraw\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"Simply the best, how did I manage without Alexa.

It's very wishy washy on giving commands to lights and doesn't always work when I ask Alexa to play music on a Multiroom Group.  It will play on one of the echoes but not all of the ones assigned.

I'm not a huge fan of my dot to begin with but the app just destroys any positive feelings I might have had.   One of the biggest things I use the app for is text to speech on my Kindle books. Not only can I not arrange how I want the icons to look or hide services I don't use, but I can't   search through my books for the title I want or sort them. It is also virtually impossible to just say \\\"Alexa read XXXXX\\\" because she has no idea what I'm talking about.  My roommate foumd the same thing when she tried to get the app to read to her. You have to dig through all the books to find the one you want and then hit play.   Also, Alexa is extremely  spotty with pronunciation (i.e., a character whose name is Manny sometimes gets called Man, sometimes pronounced Many and sometimes pronounced Manny; a character named Colin is sometimes prounced like Cawlin and sometimes like Colon).  All that being said, the biggest thing I hate about the app is that it randomly stops, as if a sleep timer went off and it stops reading. If I wake her up by saying \\\"Alexa\\\", she reads a few more words and then stops or she will randomly start reading again (i.e., a 3 am the book will come back on for a sentence or two and then will stop again). This would continue the whole book if I let it. Amazon says it's most likely the internet connection but I can tell you it absolutely is not.   I realize Alexa was a pioneer in AI in her early days, but one would think Amazon would have improved her since then.

Would get 5 stars if multiple lists available.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"Lesley Young\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 4,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"It's a great app but for the somet\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"Mohammed Hassen\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 5,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"I had a hard start but now it is working smoothly.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"Calvin Tillman\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 4,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"This is good product\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 5,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"Great product.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"GooglePlayStore\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 5,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"The UI is a little buggy/klunky and not quite what you'd expect from Amazon.

This is most frustrating. The music groups are useless because if you have your device connected to a Bluetooth speaker, it severs the connection and plays the music thru the device (which sounds horrible on a Dot). Furthermore, the Tap can't be added to a music group. Calling one of your other devices is interesting, but it would be more useful as an intercom without having to \\\"answer\\\" with a command. (I want to give my 3-year-old instructions in another room, but he can't answer the call) Calling another device also severs any Bluetooth connections.

Borrow a friend's compatible phone and sign in with your amazon account, then click the middle button on the bottom, follow the instructions. DO NOT ALLOW CONTACTS.

(Harmony has done a wonderful job with that on their remote control hub app). \\nAdditionally, the app must stop refreshing when behind the scenes. It must stay in the state the user placed it before going on to do other things.\\nNow Alexa herself... She NEEDS a better search engine, ability, and A.I.   I think perhaps Bing is the current search from what I understand. But that's not the whole issue. Alexia seems to be able to find and understand little of the real world and information users ask. \\nI expect at least an 8 out if 10 from Amazon. At this time, Alexa and this app are a solid 6 at best.

Another nice feature would be to link reminders to Alexa in routines, such as when I say “Alexa, Good Morning” on a Monday, she would tell me the reminders I have programmed for Mondays. Linking a smart phone “reminder” app to Alexa, to play when a routine is created, would be fabulous!  Right now, aside from asking her to play music (most of what I listen to isn’t available on Amazon Music) and use her for my morning routine to get weather, traffic, and daily briefing, I don’t use it much.  It seems to be in an infancy stage even after a couple of years.  It could be great. I look forward to when it is.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"PL Buckeye Girl\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"iTunes\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 2,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"Not much available\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2018-01-31T23:33:24.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"The app will not update when opened.

Why is there no option to set smart home, skills, shopping list or anything else for that matter as the opening screen? Why is it that in order to add a smart bulb or switch as I add to my system that I need to discover ALL devices & then have to delete many Roku channels or Hue presets that I never use?  Why is it not possible to set the device list to alphabetical and for it to remain that way? Why are there no widgets for, example, shopping or to-do lists.

My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! \\n\\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \\n\\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \\\"now playing \\\" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone.

My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that “recent” music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \\n\\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \\n\\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \\\"now playing \\\" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \\\"snappy\\\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus.

What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It’s a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I’m on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \\n\\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that “recent” music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \\n\\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \\n\\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \\\"now playing \\\" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \\\"snappy\\\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus. I would love to revert to the older version.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"kenr96\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"iTunes\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"warning for update Feb 2018\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2018-02-11T16:15:18.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"I open up the app, but login, and it  gives me an error saying please try again.

As usual, nothing specific listed in the update description other than the usual rubber stamped “improvements” crap. But many problems still persist. Automatic Bluetooth connection to external speakers (Dot) is still a thing of the past. Now requires multi-step paring each time. The app is total garbage!\\n\\nContinued problems with external Bluetooth speaker for Dot. What the hell are these developers doing? They are literally forcing people to google and Apple. In the good ole days before this app became too bloated for its on good, i could turn on my external Bluetooth speaker, ask my Alexa Dot to play music and it would automatically play through my external speaker. Those days are gone people!! LISTEN TO ME!!!! THEY ARE GONE!! NO MORE!!! Now I have to pair the dot and speaker each time I want to use the external speaker. It’s a multi-step time consuming process. These developers must be getting minimum wage as there is absolutely no incentive to get an app out there that works. They fix one thing and break another. I’m on the verge of going with Apple new home device, or even google for that matter. \\n\\nFeb 2018 review. My external blue tooth speaker will no longer work with Alexa Dot. Period! It took some figuring out but now, instead of turning on Alexa music, then my blue tooth shower radio and instantly hearing music, I have to go into settings, blue tooth, and manually connect my external speaker each time. Add to that the fact that “recent” music stations rarely work now. I have to go directly to the Tunein option and start music from there. And the downhill slide continues. \\n\\nSept 2017 review-This app continues to devolve with each update. As of the latest update you now have to manually select music for your other dot or echo if you want them both to play. I keep the echo music on all day and when I shower, I stream from my dot to the shower radio. If I ask Dot alexa to play 60's music, she says you already have a device playing and would I rather hear it on this device. If you say yes, my echo turns off and the dot plays. Certainly Bezo's can hire better developers than this. \\n\\nI still cannot fathom the idea that the developers think this update is an improvement. It is the exact opposite. Volume control and \\\"now playing \\\" features are no longer static at the bottom of the screen. Latest version May 9, 2017 cripples the ability to quickly access volume control on iPhone. Can take as many as 4 steps just to get to a volume button. And the time between these steps is not \\\"snappy\\\", if you will. The finger slide volume control is buggy. You can't even see the volume number because it's directly under your finger tip. Pitiful pitiful implementation. App is clunky and slow to respond to touches on iPhone 6 plus. I would love to revert to the older version.\",\r\n\t\t\"author\": \"kenr96\",\r\n\t\t\"review_source\": \"iTunes\",\r\n\t\t\"rating\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"warning for update Feb 2018\",\r\n\t\t\"product_name\": \"Amazon Alexa\",\r\n\t\t\"reviewed_date\": \"2018-02-15T12:10:57.000Z\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"review\": \"Been about three months since the iPhone X release I believe.
